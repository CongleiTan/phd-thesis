This repository regroups all the experiments published in my thesis entitled
"Efficient and Robust Data Clustering with Graph Signal Processing".


Requirements
============

All the experiments assume the possession of the following toolboxes:
* [GSPBox](https://github.com/epfl-lts2/gspbox)
* [Johan Paratte's thesis repo](https://github.com/jparatte/thesis), for the datasets
* [CBR Selector](https://github.com/DevinCharles/cbrSelector), optionnal
* [Export Fig](https://github.com/altmany/export_fig), optional

Please follow the installation instructions of the GSPBox before to run the code of the experiments.


Algorithms
==========

The folder algorithms contain all the code to perform the computations of the different experiments.
Only part of it is original content. Please read the files header for individual credit attributions.
